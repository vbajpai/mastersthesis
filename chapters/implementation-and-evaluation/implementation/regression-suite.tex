A regression test-suite has been added in \texttt{tests/}. The suite
\texttt{asserts} the numbers of results in each stage for a query-trace
combination. It also looks for any segmentation faults if they may have
occured. Tests can be run either individually or as a complete
suite as shown in listing \ref{lst:fv2-regression-suite}. The suite can also
run in a verbose mode to see the expected and achieved result combination for
run each test case.
