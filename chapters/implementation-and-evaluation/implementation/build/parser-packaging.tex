Parser Directory Organization:\\Source code has been moved to
\lstinline!parser/src/!, and documentation has been moved to
\lstinline!parser/docs/!.\\Queries and Examples traces have been moved
to \lstinline!parser/examples/!

Parser Installation is now Painless:\\Apparatenly there is a bug in
\lstinline!numexpr! which imports externals dependencies in its egg
files.\\As a result, installation from a requirements file fails
{[}1{]}.

To circumvent the issue, I have created a custom Makefile that virtually
creates an additional preprocessing pass to install
\lstinline!numexpr!'s dependencies before going forward with
installation from \lstinline!requirements.txt!.

\begin{lstlisting}
make: numexpr
        (pip install -r requirements.txt)

numexpr: numpy
        (pip install numexpr==2.0.1)

numpy: cython
        (pip install numpy==1.6.1)

cython:
        (pip install Cython==0.15.1)

clean:
        rm -f -r build/
        rm -f -r src/*.pyc
        rm -f -r flowy-run/
        rm -f -r parsetab.py parser.out
        rm -f -r examples/output.h5
\end{lstlisting}

A detailed \lstinline!README.md! file has been included to provide build
instructions with \lstinline!virtualenvwrapper! and usage.
