In order to be able to make comparisons on field offsets, the grouper
initially creates a copy of the pointers in the filtered recordset. A n\"aive
approach is to linearly walk through all the pointers against each pointer in
the copy leading to a complexity of $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of flow
records. A smarter approach is to put the copy in a hash table and then try to
map each pointer while walking down the recordset once, leading to a
complexity of $O(n)$. The hash table approach, although will work on this
specific example, will fail badly on other relative comparisons. The F$(v1)$
\marginpar{functional grouping using qsort and bsearch} execution engine
\cite{jschauer:thesis:2011} formulates an approach to grouping records using a
binary search after a quick sort on the field offset of the first grouping
rule of each record in the filtered recordset. This helps the grouper perform
faster search lookups to find records that must group together in $O(n*lg(k))$
time with a preprocessing step taking $O(n*lg(n)) + O(n)$ in the worst case,
where $n$ is the number of flow records and $k$ is the number of unique flow
records that passed the filter.  The implementation of this idea was broken
and used to segfault at multiple steps within the grouping stage.  $F(v2)$
introduces a completely functional implementation of this approach that does
not incorporate any assumptions on the type of field offsets and is robust
enough to work with different types of grouping queries.

The approach of grouping records using \texttt{qsort} and \texttt{bsearch}
definitely is an improvement. However, it appears having an actual binary
search tree would benefit more, whereby one of the recordset will be traversed
sequentially in $O(n)$ time and for each record, the comparison will be
performed by tree lookups in $O(log(n))$ time bringing down the complexity to
$O(nlog(n))$ and is a future action item. In \marginpar{using search trees and
hash tables} addition, it would be best if the engine can figure out the
type of the relative comparison to trigger a hash table lookup for equality
comparisons to bring down the complexity to $O(n)$ for this specific case.

The reetrant \texttt{qsort\_r} was used, since it can pass an additional
argument \texttt{thunk} to the comparator, which in our case is the field
offset used for comparing two flow records. Since the order of arguments of
\texttt{qsort\_r} are \marginpar{cross platform qsort\_r and bsearch\_r}
different for \texttt{glibc} and \texttt{BSD}, the function invocation had to
be wrapped around platform specific macros as shown in listing
\ref{lst:fv2-qsortr}. More Surprisingly, there is currently no equivalent
\texttt{bsearch\_r} to complement \texttt{qsort\_r}. As such, the contemporary
\texttt{bsearch} function from the \texttt{glibc} library was adapted to
accommodate the void and is defined in \texttt{utils} module.

Group records are a conglomeration of several flow records with some common
characteristics defined by the flow query. Some of the non-common
characteristics can also be aggregated into a single value using group
\marginpar{groups as cooked netflow v5 records} aggregations as shown in
listing \ref{lst:fv2-aggr-example}. Since, the execution engine supports
multiple verbosity levels, it is useful if a single group record can be again
mapped into a NetFlow $v5$ record template, so that it can be echoed as the
representative of all its members. This was achieved using a struct
\texttt{group} as shown in listing \ref{lst:fv2-group-struct}.

There can be a situtation where the query designer might incorrectly ask
for aggregation on a field already specified in a grouper (or filter)
module. If \marginpar{ignoring redundant aggregation requests} the
relative operator is an equality comparison, the aggregation on such a
field becomes less useful, since the members of the grouped record will
always have the same value for that field. The engine is now smart to
realize this redundant request and ignores such aggregations as shown in
listing \ref{lst:fv2-aggr-example}.

Records are clubbed together into one group if no group modules are defined.
Previously such a query used to form groups for each individual filtered
record. \marginpar{clubbing records with no grouper rules} That was less
useful since then it was not possible to calculate meaningful aggregations on
all the records that passed the filter stage. Now, when the group modules are
empty, all the filtered records are clubbed into one group to allow
aggregations as shown in listing \ref{lst:fv2-club-example}.
