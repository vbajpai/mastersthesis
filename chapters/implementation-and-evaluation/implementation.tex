The effort to provide a clean usable implementation of the language was from
the initial outset backed up by three goals. The first goal was to allow the
implementation to flawlessly walk through all stages of the pipeline without
incurring major performance overhead. The second goal was to abstract out the
engine functionality in such a way so as to allow runtime evaluation of the
flow query. The third goal was to provide a clean layout of the working code
with a seamless build process to allow future developers to quickly get
started on top of the current snapshot. This was supplemented by a thorough
regression and benchmarking suite to make the code verifiable. This chapter
introduces the inner workings of the code to explains how these goals were set
into practise and brought to life.
