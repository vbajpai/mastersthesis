To be able to run and reproduce the benchmarking results as and when required
it was essential to automate the whole process. The target design was to be
able to use one script to run all sets of query-trace combination in one go
for each network analysis application as shown in listing
\ref{lst:fv2-automated-benchmarking}. The directories containing the traces
and the queries required by the script can be supplied as command line
arguments. Few examples are provided in \texttt{examples/}. The benchmarking
suite only runs on python $2.7$ and above. Each query-trace combination is run
$10$ times and the timings are averaged and echoed on the screen. Attention is
given to clear \texttt{pagecaches}, \texttt{dentries} and \texttt{inodes}
before each iteration invocation as shown in listing
\ref{lst:fv2-clear-caches}. The script, therefore needs to run with
\texttt{sudo} privileges. The results are saved in
\texttt{benchmarks/results/}. SiLK query files are simply bash commands
separated by a delimiter and are further discussed in the next section.
