The F$(v1)$ execution engine had chunks of memory leaks. The blocks of heap
memory were still reachable when the engine exited. As such, it was essential
to profile the engine to properly deallocate all blocks before exit. Listing
\ref{lst:fv2-engine-profile} shows the valgrind profile output of both
versions.  The $20kB$ of created and still living blocks in the current
snapshot are due two libraries. The \texttt{dyld} library makes $81$
\texttt{malloc} invocations that are not free'd by the library as shown in
figure \ref{fig:profile-invocations}. On GNU/Linux, \texttt{dyld} is replaced
is by \texttt{dlopen} which does not have this issue. The other set of
libraries, \texttt{libsystem\_c, libsystem\_notify, libdispatch} make $10$
\texttt{malloc} invocations that are again not free'd as shown in figure
\ref{fig:profile-invocations}.  These \texttt{malloc} calls invoke
\texttt{localtime(\ldots)} which uses \texttt{tzset(...)} to initialize and
return \texttt{struct tm*}. This structure is never free'd apparently due to
a bug in these libraries.
