The effort to provide a clean usable implementation of the language was from
the initial outset backed up by three goals. The first goal was to allow the
implementation to flawlessly work through all stages of the pipeline without
incurring major performance overhead. The second goal was to abstract out the
engine functionality in such a way so as to allow runtime evaluation of the
flow query. The third goal was to provide a clean layout of the working code
to allow future developers to quickly get started on top of the current
snapshot. This chapter introduces and reasons out the design patterns and
the user functionality envisaged from the finished product.
