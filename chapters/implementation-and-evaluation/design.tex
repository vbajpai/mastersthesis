With a software that has underwent such significant iterative lifecycles over
the past few years, it is imperative to understand and analyze the inner
working of the application before diving in to add more functionality. Reverse
engineering the current snapshot not only helped identify glitches to give a
head start with preliminary improvements, but also enabled understanding the
design of the eventual execution workflow. It is also helped in early
visualization of a complete engine refactor to introduce abstract objects that
made it possible to evaluate the flowquery at runtime. This chapter starts off
with the analysis to set a platform for reasoning out the design patterns and
the user functionality envisaged from the finished product.
