The \ac{NFQL} engine installation on OS X is quite similar. The external
dependecies can either be installed from source or using a package manager.
It is recommended to use
Homebrew\footnote{\url{http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/}} to install the
external dependencies \marginpar{nfql engine on osx} since it does not require
and plague the install with \texttt{sudo} privileges and installs the packages
at \texttt{/usr/local/}. The external dependencies are shown in listing
\ref{lst:nfql-engine-osx}. The build and usage instructions are also listed.
The build environment was tested on OS X Lion $10.7$.

There is a ruby \texttt{gem} for \texttt{flow-tools} in the Homebrew package
repository, however currently it fails to build. The $v0.68$ stable build at
splintered.net\footnote{\url{http://www.splintered.net/sw/flow-tools/}} has a
bug\footnote{\url{http://ensight.eos.nasa.gov/FlowViewer/faq.html#14}} that
inhibits it from correctly parsing the trace timestamps \marginpar{flow-tools
issues on osx} on $64$-bit machines. A forked flow-tools
branch\footnote{\url{https://code.google.com/p/flow-tools/}} resolves the
$64$-bit issues but then the latest stable release $v0.68.5.1$ does not build
successfully. The previous release of the forked branch $v0.68.4$ works well
and is used by the execution engine on OS X.
