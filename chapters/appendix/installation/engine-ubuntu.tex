The \ac{NFQL} Engine uses CMake to prepare the build. As a result, the
installation process is quite seamless.  The external dependencies that need
\marginpar{nfql engine on debian/ubuntu}  to be installed are shown in listing
\ref{lst:nfql-engine-ubuntu}. The build and usage instructions are also
listed. The build environment was tested on $64$-bit machines runing Debian
Squeeze, Ubuntu $10.04$ and $12.04$.
