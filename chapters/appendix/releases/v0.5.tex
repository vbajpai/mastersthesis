The execution engine is now verifiable using a full-fledged regression suite,
alongwith an automated benchmarking suite. The python parser \marginpar{it's
verifiable} implementation has been properly packaged to allow seamless
single-step installation using \texttt{make} and \texttt{pip}. The
installation and usage instructions for both Debian/Ubuntu and OS X are
included.  The workset of the release is shown in listing \ref{lst:v0.5}.
