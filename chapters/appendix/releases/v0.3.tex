The execution engine is now flexible to read and parse the entire flowquery at
\emph{runtime}, tagged as $v0.3$. The flowquery is written in an intermediate
\texttt{JSON} format and read using \texttt{json-c}. The \texttt{JSON} queries
are themselves generated using python scripts. The engine is fail-safe using
\marginpar{it's flexible} consistency checks that allow it to fail gracefully
when either the trace or the flowquery cannot be read. Each branch thread can
now exit early on failure and each stage of the pipeline only proceeds when
the previous stage returned results. A workset of the release is shown in
listing \ref{lst:v0.3}.
