This tag represents an evolution of the core of the former Python
implementation (Flowy) in C. It is also referred as F$(v1)$. It can
efficiently read flow records into memory and filter them. Each branch of the
pipeline runs in a \marginpar{it's a start} separate thread. Each rule type
has its own dedicated function pointer generated using a python script. The
idea of using \texttt{qsort/bsearch} for efficient grouper processing is in
place, but the implementation is broken with numerous segfaults. The engine
has concerns as shown in listing \ref{lst:v0.0}.

Commit 8cb309c8a956c99e6b1494eddb601c8f6a520696

* read flow-records into memory
* rewrite of the execution pipeline in C (non functional)
* efficient rule processing with dedicated function pointers
* reduced grouper complexity using qsort(...) and bsearch(...)
* concerns
        - flow query is currently hardcoded in pipeline structs
        - functions assume specific uintX_t offsets
        - numerous grouper segfaults
        - no group filter, no ungrouper
        - commented out merger (segfaults when uncommented)
        - code dependent on GNU99 extensions
        - some headers are missing include guards
        - unused extraneous source files and headers
\end{lstlisting}
