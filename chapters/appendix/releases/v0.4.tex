The execution engine is now portable to be able to seamlessly build on
multiple Unix flavors, tagged as $v0.4$. CMake is used to orchestrate the
build process. It uses custom commands to invoke scripts that can prepare the
auto-generated \marginpar{it's portable} sources and sample \texttt{JSON}
queries. A Makefile is used to automate the CMake invocations. Feature-test
and platform-specific macros allow the code to become portable. The snapshot
contains installation instructions for both Debian/Ubuntu and OS X. A workset
of the release is shown in listing \ref{lst:v0.4}.
