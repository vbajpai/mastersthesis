Commit 2c571f80cd076172cbd00ef7f9976b88cb44b425

* complete engine refactor.
* complete engine profiling (no memory leaks).
* issues closed:
    - greedily deallocating non-filtered records in `O(n)` before `merger(â€¦)`.
    - resolved a grouper segfault when NO records got filtered.
    - all records are grouped into 1 group when no grouping rule specified.
    - aggregation on common fields touched by filter/grouper rules is ignored.
    - no `uintX_t` assumptions for field offsets.
    - rules are clubbed together and assigned using a loop.
    - function parameters are as minimum as required.
    - function parameters are safe using `[const]` ptr and ptr to `[const]`.
    - lazy `rule->func(â€¦)` assignment when the stage is entered.
