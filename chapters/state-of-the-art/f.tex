In lieu of the significant leaps made by Flowy $2.0$ in making the initial prototype usable, additional efforts were made by the same author to work upon the enlisted areas of improvements mentioned in $\ref{sec:flowy2-future}$. To mark this evolution of initial prototype to the current bleeding edge state, it was decided to rename the implementation to F \cite{jschauer:2012} with an exhaustive performance evaluation against the state-of-the-art flow processing tools \cite{sromig:2000, phaag:2006} that operate on absolute filters.
