The developed stream-based flow-querier helped to underpin a number of recent research efforts to solve real-world application problems that were deemed difficult before. This was possible due to the power and flexibility of the flow-query language to suit itself from generic to specific needs thereby opening doors of innovation. This section documents such efforts that use the in-house flow query language as well as a few others that exploit the flow level characteristics of the traffic patterns in general.
