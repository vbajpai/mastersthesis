%***********************************************************************

Flowy, although clearly setting itself apart with its additional functionality to query intricate patterns in the flows demonstrates relatively high execution times when compared to contemporary flow-processing tools. A recent study \cite{pnemeth:thesis:2010} revealed that a sample query run on small record set (around 250MB) took 19 minutes on Flowy as compared to 45 seconds on \texttt{flow-tools}. It, therefore is imperative that the application will benefit from distributed and parallel processing. To this end, recent efforts were made to investigate possibility of making Flowy Map/Reduce aware \cite{pnemeth:thesis:2010}
