The network and user behavior traffic pattern analysis is creating a lot of
traction owing to its wide applicability in accounting, resource provisioning
and network monitoring purposes. This section is dedicated to perform an
exhaustive study on the available techniques that can perform such traffic
measurements and how they are being used today. In particular, we focus our
attention to the currently favored flow-capture technique by examining the
de-facto protocols that describe the semantics of this flow-export. The
organization of the section is described below.

In chapter $\ref{ch:traffic-measurement-approaches}$ we discuss the current
state-of-the-art traffic measurement techniques, the protocols supporting
them, their pros and cons and how they are being used to mine the behavioral
patterns of the current network traffic. 

In chapter $\ref{ch:flow-export-protocols}$ we discuss Cisco's proprietary and
\ac{IETF}'s standardized protocol for \ac{IP} flow export. We discuss their
architecture, protocol operations, their message formats and the future they
are heading towards as seen from today.
